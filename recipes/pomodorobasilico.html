<h1>Spaghetti Al Pomodoro e Basilico</h1>
<img src="/home/brandon/repos/odin-recipes/images/Pomodoro.jpg">
<p>This is a simple, yet delicious and classic italian dish that relies on tomatoes and basil. Be sure not to skimp out on fresh basil! It is absolutely necessary!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Fresh basil</li>
    <li>Red Pepper Flakes</li>
    <li>Spaghetti</li>
    <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Blanch the tomatoes and remove the skins. Cut in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Cut the tomatoes crosswise. Set aside in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Heat 3 ounces olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until it smokes slightly. Add tomatoes, salt, pepper and crushed red pepper. Since the tomatoes will reduce and the salt will be concentrated, it is better to season initially with a lighter hand.</li>
    <li>Chop the tomatoes with a potato masher until they are in fine chunks and all their liquid is released. Be sure they are chopped and crushed fine, for a semichunky sauce. Simmer for 25 minutes over medium heat.</li>
    <li>While the sauce simmers, heat the water for the pasta. Cook the spaghetti in salted water about half of the way cooked. Drain, reserving some of the water.</li>
    <li>Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Add the pasta to the sauce and cook over medium-high heat until all the liquid is absorbed and the pasta is al dente. If the sauce is over-reduced, use the pasta cooking liquid to adjust it.</li>
    <li>At the last moment, remove the pan from the heat; add the extra-virgin olive oil, butter, basil and cheese. Mix thoroughly until the pasta is an orangy color. Taste again and adjust the salt if necessary. Remove to a platter. Serve.</li>
